# Ig_clone-Data-Analysis-using-MySQL

Hi All,

In this Project I have answered several business questions with the help of SQL Queries.

In Ig_Clone Database we have 7 tables(comments,follows,likes,photo_tags,photos,tags,users).

I have attached the ER Diagram of the database as well for better understanding of the relationships among tables.

Thanks Odinschool for providing this dataset and Challenges.
